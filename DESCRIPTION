Description: Datasets for 'nlmixr2' and 'rxode2'. 'nlmixr2' is uesd for fitting and comparing
    nonlinear mixed-effects models in differential
    equations with flexible dosing information commonly seen in pharmacokinetics
    and pharmacodynamics (Almquist, Leander, and Jirstrand 2015 
    <doi:10.1007/s10928-015-9409-1>). Differential equation solving is 
    by compiled C code provided in the 'rxode2' package
    (Wang, Hallow, and James 2015 <doi:10.1002/psp4.12052>).
