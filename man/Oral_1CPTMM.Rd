\description{
This is a simulated dataset from the ACOP 2016 poster.  All
Datasets were simulated with the following methods.
}
\details{
Richly sampled profiles were simulated for 4 different dose levels
(10, 30, 60 and 120 mg) of 30 subjects each as single dose (over
72h), multiple dose (4 daily doses), single and multiple dose
combined, and steady state dosing, for a range of test models: 1-
and 2-compartment disposition, with and without 1st order
absorption, with either linear or Michaelis-Menten (MM)
clearance(MM without steady state dosing). This provided a total
of 42 test cases. All inter-individual variabilities (IIVs) were
set at 30\%, residual error at 20\% and overlapping PK parameters
were the same for all models. A similar set of models was
previously used to compare NONMEM and Monolix4. Estimates of
population parameters, standard errors for fixed-effect
parameters, and run times were compared both for closed-form
solutions and using ODEs. Additionally, a sparse data estimation
situation was investigated where 500 datasets of 600 subjects each
(150 per dose) were generated consisting of 4 random time point
samples in 24 hours per subject, using a first-order absorption,
1-compartment disposition, linear elimination model.
